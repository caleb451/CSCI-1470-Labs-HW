/*
  Think about the two solutions. Which do you prefer? I prefer Solution 2
  because the conditions within the if and else-if statments are much
  shorter and easier to read.

  Another consideration is to write a fast running program. Solution 1
  may require testing many conditions. With solution 2 we first
  decide if gender is M or F, the only test the conditions that apply
  to that gender. Consider the case where we have a female who is over 30.
  In Solution 1, we have 4 if/else-if statments to test before we get to
  the correct condition. In Solution 2 we have two statements to test.
