// Read the handout carefully for detailed description of the functions that you have to implement


// This function receives an input file with data about rooms in a hotel.
// Each row of the file represents a floor in the hotel. You do not know ahead of time how many floors there are in the hotel.
// Each room is represented by a single digit: 1 (the room is occupied) or 0 (the room is not occupied).
// Because each floor can have a different number of rooms, the value -1 is used to indicate that the end of data for that floor has been reached.
// The function must print the header of the table followed by the floor number, the number of rooms occupied in that floor, and the occupancy
// rate (percentage of rooms occupied) for that floor. Below this information it must display the 
// overall occupancy rate (total number of occupied rooms/total number of rooms) for the whole hotel.
// The rates must be displayed real numbers with a single decimal digit.
